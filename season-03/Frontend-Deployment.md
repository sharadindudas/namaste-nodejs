# Devtinder Frontend Deployment on AWS EC2

-   Signup on AWS
-   Launch an instance of AWS EC2
-   Create a key-pair to login to your instance and use chmod 400 <secret>.pem command to grant permission to access the secret key to login to your instance (Ubuntu machine) (For Linux Users)
-   To grant permission to access the key for windows users are the following commands:
    -   icacls.exe <secret>.pem /reset
    -   icacls.exe <secret>.pem /grant:r "$($env:username):(r)"
    -   icacls.exe <secret>.pem /inheritance:r
-   Paste your command (ssh -i ....) on the terminal and you will be able to access your instance of ubuntu machine
-   Install Node.js on your ubuntu machine and make sure the version of both (local and ubuntu) exactly matches or not
-   Clone your repositories of the project to get them into your ubuntu and install and required dependencies accordingly using npm i / npm install
-   For the devtinder frontend:
    -   npm i to install dependencies
    -   npm run build to bundle all the files together for production ready application
    -   sudo apt update to update every packages inside ubuntu
    -   sudo apt install nginx to run a web server inside our ubuntu machine
    -   sudo systemctl start nginx
    -   sudo systemctl enable nginx
    -   Now to copy the dist/build files inside /var/www/html/ to run our application on nginx we have to use the command sudo scp -r dist/\* /var/www/html/
    -   Now to allow the nginx server to get all the requests we have to allow the PORT 80 (default port for nginx) to allow it we have to mention the PORT number in the security rules of our instance
    -   Now we can see our frontend running smoothly on the Public IPv4 address and make sure to use http:// instead of https:// (Took me some time to figure this out)
